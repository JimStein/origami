#A VPython Origami Simulator

This application is a 3D origami simulator that allows you to fold your own virtual origami, have the folds be animated step by step, and save your origami pattern. You can also load origami that have been folded by others and replay them in 3D, or modify them.

The application was written using wxPython version 2.9.4.0 and VPython version 6.05. It has been tested under OSX 10.8 and 10.9. The wxPython module can be downloaded [here](http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#unstable) (download and install the development release, and Cocoa version for OSX), and VPython can be downloaded [here](http://www.vpython.org/contents/download_mac.html) (for OSX).

When running, make sure that all nine of the image files are in the "img" folder which is in the same directory as the Origami.py file. To run the program, go to the directory that Origami.py is in terminal and enter "python Origami.py".
